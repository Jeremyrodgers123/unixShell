# unix Shell Project

-	Demonstrated understanding of operating system processes by creating my own version of the Unix shell. 
-	Parses user input from the command line to derive commands, forks a new child process per command, handles pipes using file descriptor redirects of standard in/out (thereby allowing multiple commands to be chained together), and finally executes.
